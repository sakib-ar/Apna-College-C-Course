Practice Question 07: Are the following valid or not?

a. int a = 8^8
b. int x; int y = x;
c. int x, y = x;
d. char stars = '**';

Solution:

a. Invalid. No semi-colon at the end. But if we assume the semi-colon was there, then it is correct. It will act as a bitwise operator, so 8^8 is 8 XOR 8 which is 0
b. Valid. Declared correctly.
c. Invalid. Cannot be comma
d. Invalid. Cannot use multiple character in char, only single character is allowed.
